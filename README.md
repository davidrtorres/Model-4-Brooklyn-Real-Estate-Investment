# Time Series Model Forecasting of Real Estate Data from Zillow.com
## **TOP FIVE BROOKLYN ZIPCODES TO INVEST IN** 

Author:  David R. Torres

The Model 4 project task was to create models for time series forecasting.  The project consisted of acting as a consultant for a real estate firm and they asked me to provide analysis and recommendations of the 5 best zipcodes in Brooklyn to invest in.  The top zipcodes would be based on the highest Return on Investment and risk vs. profitability. The investment firm was looking for short-term investments with the highest returns over a 3 year period. The investment firm wasn't interested in long term investments which require purchasing property and keeping them to increase in value.

### **Data**
I worked with real estate sales data from Zillow.com which covered the time period 4-1-1996 to 4-1-2018.  I created models for a univariate Series.  I did not include categories other than the monthly mean sales prices for each zipcode. 

### **Methods**
I used an auto_arima model to find the lowest AIC scores and corresponding p,d,qs. I split the data into a train and test set and used a SARIMA model to make predictions regarding the test data so I get an idea of how my models were working with making predictionss.

## **Business Problem**
The investment firm has asked to provide an analysis and recommendations regarding the top 5 zipcodes in Brooklyn to investment in.
