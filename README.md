## Time Series Model Forecasting of Real Estate Data from Zillow.com
## **TOP FIVE BROOKLYN ZIPCODES TO INVEST IN** 

Author:  David R. Torres<br>

Problem: I am a consultant for a real estate firm and they asked me to provide analysis and recommendations of the 5 best zipcodes in Brooklyn that will provide the highest return on investment. The investment firm looking for short-term investments and looking for the highest returns over a 3 year period. The investment firm isn't looking for investments where a family will purchase a home and stay in the home 10 to 15 years to build equity.
I worked with real estate sales data from Zillow which covers time period 4-1-1996 to 4-1-2018.
I used an auto_arima model to find the lowest AIC scores and corresponding p,d,qs. I split the data into a train and test set and used a SARIMA model to make predictions regarding the test data so I get an idea of how my models were working with making predictionss.

## **Business Problem**
